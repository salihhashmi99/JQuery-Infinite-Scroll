# JQuery-Infinite-Scroll
Infinite scrolling is a functionality allowing users to scroll down a massive amount of information, presenting it in easy-to-consume chunks. Some developers believe this method is a silver bullet for any site, as it keeps users engaged, but that's not true.  Infinite scrolling has the potential to make a web page nearly endless. Making users continuously scroll down the page to see, say, previous blog posts or products belonging to the same category may frustrate them, causing page abandonment. Information overload is another issue that users may face when visiting such pages.  The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery will run exactly the same in all major browsers.
